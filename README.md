Project Title: Optimal Meal Plan Creator 

Objective: Designing an algorithm that generates an optimal weekly meal plan minimizing cost while maximizing nutrition as per the body's daily requirements, and accommodating dietary restrictions, preferences, and budget constraints

. Designed an Integer programming-based algorithm with OPL language in CPLEX that generates weekly meal plans with 12 variety meals

. The range of nutrition is constrained based on 'The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition' article on nutritional status and dietary intake 

. Categorized meal type as breakfast, lunch and dinner, ensuring each meal type appears at least once but no more than thrice per week
