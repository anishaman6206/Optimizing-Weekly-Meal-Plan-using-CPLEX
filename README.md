# Optimal Meal Plan Creator

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to design an algorithm that generates an optimal weekly meal plan that minimizes cost while maximizing nutrition according to the body's daily requirements. The algorithm accommodates dietary restrictions, preferences, and budget constraints.

## Objectives

- Design an algorithm to generate optimal weekly meal plans.
- Minimize the cost of meals while maximizing nutritional value.
- Ensure the meal plan meets the body's daily nutritional requirements.
- Accommodate dietary restrictions, preferences, and budget constraints.

## Methodology

- **Algorithm Design**: Developed an Integer programming-based algorithm using OPL language in CPLEX.
- **Meal Plan Generation**: The algorithm generates weekly meal plans with 12 different meals.
- **Nutritional Constraints**: The range of nutrition is constrained based on an article from 'The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition' on nutritional status and dietary intake.
- **Meal Categorization**: Meals are categorized into breakfast, lunch, and dinner, ensuring each meal type appears at least once but no more than thrice per week.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an Integer programming-based algorithm to create cost-effective and nutritionally optimal weekly meal plans, accommodating various dietary restrictions and preferences.
